# Introduction to AI Integration in Teaching 

## Motivation
The motivation behind the approach of AI Integration in the training process is to develop **well-rounded web developers equipped with AI-enhanced programming skills**.  
Our goal is to prepare students who are proficient in the latest programming languages and frameworks, and who have cultivated an **intuitive understanding of writing efficient, secure, and maintainable code** while making **effective use of AI tools** as part of their workflow.

## Core Premise 
AI skills are **not an additional module**, but an integral part of the overall teaching process. Each course, from introductory to advanced, will include segments dedicated to the use of AI tools and concepts relevant to that specific domain. This comprehensive integration ensures that students continuously apply and refine their AI skills throughout their studies. 

## Teaching Focus 
Emphasis on **understanding core concepts** and **rapid prototyping**, rather than memorizing syntax or learning every detail exhaustively. 
AI serves as an **assistant for code generation, debugging, and explanations**, allowing instructors to focus on: 
- Architectural concepts 
- Best practices 
- Critical thinking 

### Working with Prompts 
Instructors must be trained in **good and bad prompting techniques**. 
This knowledge should be passed on to students, demonstrating how effective prompts can guide AI tools to provide meaningful and contextually accurate responses.
  

### Evaluating AI Responses
Students should also be taught **how to critically evaluate AI-generated answers**.  
While they do **not need to memorize syntax**, they **must be able to assess whether the provided response is accurate, reasonable, and applicable** to the task at hand.  
This skill ensures that AI is used as a **supportive assistant**, rather than a source of unquestioned truth, fostering independent judgment and effective problem-solving.
